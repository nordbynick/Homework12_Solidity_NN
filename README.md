**Questions:**

*Question 1: How does the contract work?*

*Question 2: What is the motivation?*

**Screenshots:**

*Question 3: How to send a transaction?*

*Question 4:How is the transferred amount distributed?*

*Question 5:How can the timelock functionality can be tested with the fastforward function?*
